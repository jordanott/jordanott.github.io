    My goal is to pursue a PhD in machine learning and Aritificial Intelligence with emphasis in neural computation.
    When I'm not conjuring algorithms in my stereotypical computer scientist's laire, you can find me doing something outdoors.
    I love to hike, run and explore new places. I'll also crush you in a game of ping pong.
