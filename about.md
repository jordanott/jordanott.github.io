I am machine learning researcher at Chapman University's [MLAT Lab](http://mlat.chapman.edu/). I finished my Bachelors degree in three years and am currently working on my Masters in Computational Data Science. I plan to go on for my PhD starting in the fall of 2018.  

My dream is to be a research scientist at a place like Google DeepMind or OpenAI. My areas of interest include computer vision, reinforcement learning and transfer learning.
